## Hyphae
Generate some branching diagrams.
I decided to try this after reading [this blogpost by inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/generative/hyphae/).

## Usage
`run.bat` to run

`up arrow` and `down arrow` to change number of initial points 

`f` to hide diagram until finished

`space` to generate a diagram

`tab` to hide ui

`esc` to exit
